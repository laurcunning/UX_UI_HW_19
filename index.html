		<div id="panel">I'm an emerging user experience designer based out of Toronto, ON. I live in the city with 
			my partner and our corgi puppy, Max. In my spare time I enjoy cooking, yoga, weight training, board games and good cup of coffee.

			Prior to pursuing UX/UI design, my background has been in social work. For the past 
			five years I've working as a case manager to homeless youth. I've always been driven to work with people - offering empathy, connection
			and understanding towards others and their experiences. I also look to understand the cause and effect of human behaviours and want to be 
			a contributing member in working towards a larger solution. 

			I discovered UX/UI throughout the pandemic and have made the decisions to pursue it as a career. I've realsed my passion for design stems from 
			how it aligns with my creative interests and desire for solving problems; while also allowing me to develop practical solutions and designs that 
			provide individuals the best experience. 

			What I enjoy most about UX/UI design is how it ties together human centred problems, visual and interactive design and research-based solutions. 
			My approach to solving user problems is based on quantitative and qualitative research. I work to understand the user - uncovering their journey,
			pain points, needs and insights. I practice design thinking methods and understand the importance of the entire design process rather than just focusing on the end result. 
			I find enjoyment in that the design process is not linear. I love how to provokes curiousity and creative thinking buy presenting me with new challenges, setbacks 
			and requires iterations before reaching a breakthrough. My design process motivates me to close the gap between the user and their desired experience. 
			I have found a passion for pursuing design I didn't know I had, and am eager to continue to learn as it is an always evolving and ongoing process. </div>
